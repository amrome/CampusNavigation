## 💡 Tips

- If you don't have professional photos, you can use:
  - Your phone camera (make sure it's well-lit)
  - Stock photos temporarily (replace later)
  - Screenshots from Google Maps for building exteriors
- For the logo, if you don't have a PNG:

  - I can help convert it
  - Or we can use text temporarily

- For room photos, any classroom/office photos will work
  - Try to show different types of rooms
  - Include some empty rooms and some with furniture
